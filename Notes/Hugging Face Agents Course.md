# Introduction to Agents

![Thumbnail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/thumbnail.jpg)

Welcome to this first unit, where **you’ll build a solid foundation in the fundamentals of AI Agents** including:

- **Understanding Agents**
    
    - What is an Agent, and how does it work?
    - How do Agents make decisions using reasoning and planning?
- **The Role of LLMs (Large Language Models) in Agents**
    
    - How LLMs serve as the “brain” behind an Agent.
    - How LLMs structure conversations via the Messages system.
- **Tools and Actions**
    
    - How Agents use external tools to interact with the environment.
    - How to build and integrate tools for your Agent.
- **The Agent Workflow:**
    
    - _Think_ → _Act_ → _Observe_.

After exploring these topics, **you’ll build your first Agent** using `smolagents`!

Your Agent, named Alfred, will handle a simple task and demonstrate how to apply these concepts in practice.

You’ll even learn how to **publish your Agent on Hugging Face Spaces**, so you can share it with friends and colleagues.

Finally, at the end of this Unit, you’ll take a quiz. Pass it, and you’ll **earn your first course certification**: the 🎓 Certificate of Fundamentals of Agents.

![Certificate Example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/certificate-example.jpg)

This Unit is your **essential starting point**, laying the groundwork for understanding Agents before you move on to more advanced topics.

![Unit 1 planning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/whiteboard-no-check.jpg)

It’s a big unit, so **take your time** and don’t hesitate to come back to these sections from time to time.

Ready? Let’s dive in! 🚀

# What is an Agent?

![Unit 1 planning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/whiteboard-no-check.jpg)

By the end of this section, you’ll feel comfortable with the concept of agents and their various applications in AI.

To explain what an Agent is, let’s start with an analogy.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-agents#the-big-picture-alfred-the-agent)The Big Picture: Alfred The Agent

Meet Alfred. Alfred is an **Agent**.

![This is Alfred](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/this-is-alfred.jpg)

Imagine Alfred **receives a command**, such as: “Alfred, I would like a coffee please.”

![I would like a coffee](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/coffee-please.jpg)

Because Alfred **understands natural language**, he quickly grasps our request.

Before fulfilling the order, Alfred engages in **reasoning and planning**, figuring out the steps and tools he needs to:

1. Go to the kitchen
2. Use the coffee machine
3. Brew the coffee
4. Bring the coffee back

![Reason and plan](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/reason-and-plan.jpg)

Once he has a plan, he **must act**. To execute his plan, **he can use tools from the list of tools he knows about**.

In this case, to make a coffee, he uses a coffee machine. He activates the coffee machine to brew the coffee.

![Make coffee](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/make-coffee.jpg)

Finally, Alfred brings the freshly brewed coffee to us.

![Bring coffee](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/bring-coffee.jpg)

And this is what an Agent is: an **AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with its environment**.

We call it Agent because it has _agency_, aka it has the ability to interact with the environment.

![Agent process](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/process.jpg)

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-agents#lets-go-more-formal)Let’s go more formal

Now that you have the big picture, here’s a more precise definition:

> An Agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.

Think of the Agent as having two main parts:

1. **The Brain (AI Model)**

This is where all the thinking happens. The AI model **handles reasoning and planning**. It decides **which Actions to take based on the situation**.

2. **The Body (Capabilities and Tools)**

This part represents **everything the Agent is equipped to do**.

The **scope of possible actions** depends on what the agent **has been equipped with**. For example, because humans lack wings, they can’t perform the “fly” **Action**, but they can execute **Actions** like “walk”, “run” ,“jump”, “grab”, and so on.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-agents#the-spectrum-of-agency)The spectrum of “Agency”

Following this definition, Agents exist on a continuous spectrum of increasing agency:

|Agency Level|Description|What that’s called|Example pattern|
|---|---|---|---|
|☆☆☆|Agent output has no impact on program flow|Simple processor|`process_llm_output(llm_response)`|
|★☆☆|Agent output determines basic control flow|Router|`if llm_decision(): path_a() else: path_b()`|
|★★☆|Agent output determines function execution|Tool caller|`run_function(llm_chosen_tool, llm_chosen_args)`|
|★★★|Agent output controls iteration and program continuation|Multi-step Agent|`while llm_should_continue(): execute_next_step()`|
|★★★|One agentic workflow can start another agentic workflow|Multi-Agent|`if llm_trigger(): execute_agent()`|

Table from [smolagents conceptual guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/conceptual_guides/intro_agents).

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-agents#what-type-of-ai-models-do-we-use-for-agents)What type of AI Models do we use for Agents?

The most common AI model found in Agents is an #LLM (Large Language Model)], which takes **Text** as an input and outputs **Text** as well.

Well known examples are **GPT4** from **OpenAI**, **LLama** from **Meta**, **Gemini** from **Google**, etc. These models have been trained on a vast amount of text and are able to generalize well. We will learn more about LLMs in the [next section](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-llms).

It's also possible to use models that accept other inputs as the Agent's core model. For example, a Vision Language Model (VLM), which is like an LLM but also understands images as input. We'll focus on LLMs for now and will discuss other options later.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-agents#how-does-an-ai-take-action-on-its-environment)How does an #AI take action on its environment?

LLMs are amazing models, but **they can only generate text**.

However, if you ask a well-known chat application like HuggingChat or ChatGPT to generate an image, they can! How is that possible?

The answer is that the developers of HuggingChat, ChatGPT and similar apps implemented additional functionality (called **Tools**), that the LLM can use to create images.

![Eiffel Brocolis](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/eiffel_brocolis.jpg)

The model used an Image Generation Tool to generate this image.

We will learn more about tools in the [Tools](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tools) section.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-agents#what-type-of-tasks-can-an-agent-do)What type of tasks can an Agent do?

An Agent can perform any task we implement via **Tools** to complete **Actions**.

For example, if I write an Agent to act as my personal assistant (like Siri) on my computer, and I ask it to “send an email to my Manager asking to delay today’s meeting”, I can give it some code to send emails. This will be a new Tool the Agent can use whenever it needs to send an email. We can write it in Python:

Copied

def send_message_to(recipient, message):
    """Useful to send an e-mail message to a recipient"""
    ...

The LLM, as we’ll see, will generate code to run the tool when it needs to, and thus fulfill the desired task.

Copied

send_message_to("Manager", "Can we postpone today's meeting?")

The **design of the Tools is very important and has a great impact on the quality of your Agent**. Some tasks will require very specific Tools to be crafted, while others may be solved with general purpose tools like “web_search”.

> Note that **Actions are not the same as Tools**. An Action, for instance, can involve the use of multiple Tools to complete.

Allowing an agent to interact with its environment **allows real-life usage for companies and individuals**.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-agents#example-1-personal-virtual-assistants)Example 1: Personal Virtual Assistants

Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant, work as agents when they interact on behalf of users using their digital environments.

They take user queries, analyze context, retrieve information from databases, and provide responses or initiate actions (like setting reminders, sending messages, or controlling smart devices).

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-agents#example-2-customer-service-chatbots)Example 2: Customer Service Chatbots

Many companies deploy chatbots as agents that interact with customers in natural language.

These agents can answer questions, guide users through troubleshooting steps, open issues in internal databases, or even complete transactions.

Their predefined objectives might include improving user satisfaction, reducing wait times, or increasing sales conversion rates. By interacting directly with customers, learning from the dialogues, and adapting their responses over time, they demonstrate the core principles of an agent in action.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-agents#example-3-ai-non-playable-character-in-a-video-game)Example 3: AI Non-Playable Character in a video game

AI agents powered by LLMs can make Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) more dynamic and unpredictable.

Instead of following rigid behavior trees, they can **respond contextually, adapt to player interactions**, and generate more nuanced dialogue. This flexibility helps create more lifelike, engaging characters that evolve alongside the player’s actions.

---

To summarize, an Agent is a system that uses an AI Model (typically an LLM) as its core reasoning engine, to:

- **Understand natural language:** Interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way.
    
- **Reason and plan:** Analyze information, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems.
    
- **Interact with its environment:** Gather information, take actions, and observe the results of those actions.
    

Now that you have a solid grasp of what Agents are, let’s reinforce your understanding with a short, ungraded quiz. After that, we’ll dive into the “Agent’s brain”: the [LLMs](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-llms).

# What are LLMs?

![Unit 1 planning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/whiteboard-check-1.jpg)

In the previous section we learned that each Agent needs **an AI Model at its core**, and that LLMs are the most common type of AI models for this purpose.

Now we will learn what LLMs are and how they power Agents.

This section offers a concise technical explanation of the use of LLMs. If you want to dive deeper, you can check our [free Natural Language Processing Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1).

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-llms#what-is-a-large-language-model)What is a Large Language Model?

An LLM is a type of AI model that excels at **understanding and generating human language**. They are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to learn patterns, structure, and even nuance in language. These models typically consist of many millions of parameters.

Most LLMs nowadays are **built on the Transformer architecture**—a deep learning architecture based on the “Attention” algorithm, that has gained significant interest since the release of BERT from Google in 2018.

![Transformer](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/transformer.jpg)

The original Transformer architecture looked like this, with an encoder on the left and a decoder on the right.

There are 3 types of transformers:

1. **Encoders**  
    An encoder-based Transformer takes text (or other data) as input and outputs a dense representation (or embedding) of that text.
    
    - **Example**: BERT from Google
    - **Use Cases**: Text classification, semantic search, Named Entity Recognition
    - **Typical Size**: Millions of parameters
2. **Decoders**  
    A decoder-based Transformer focuses **on generating new tokens to complete a sequence, one token at a time**.
    
    - **Example**: Llama from Meta
    - **Use Cases**: Text generation, chatbots, code generation
    - **Typical Size**: Billions (in the US sense, i.e., 10^9) of parameters
3. **Seq2Seq (Encoder–Decoder)**  
    A sequence-to-sequence Transformer _combines_ an encoder and a decoder. The encoder first processes the input sequence into a context representation, then the decoder generates an output sequence.
    
    - **Example**: T5, BART
    - **Use Cases**: Translation, Summarization, Paraphrasing
    - **Typical Size**: Millions of parameters

Although Large Language Models come in various forms, LLMs are typically decoder-based models with billions of parameters. Here are some of the most well-known LLMs:

|**Model**|**Provider**|
|---|---|
|**Deepseek-R1**|DeepSeek|
|**GPT4**|OpenAI|
|**Llama 3**|Meta (Facebook AI Research)|
|**SmolLM2**|Hugging Face|
|**Gemma**|Google|
|**Mistral**|Mistral|

The underlying principle of an LLM is simple yet highly effective: **its objective is to predict the next token, given a sequence of previous tokens**. A “token” is the unit of information an LLM works with. You can think of a “token” as if it was a “word”, but for efficiency reasons LLMs don’t use whole words.

For example, while English has an estimated 600,000 words, an LLM might have a vocabulary of around 32,000 tokens (as is the case with Llama 2). Tokenization often works on sub-word units that can be combined.

For instance, consider how the tokens “interest” and “ing” can be combined to form “interesting”, or “ed” can be appended to form “interested.”

You can experiment with different tokenizers in the interactive playground below:

Each LLM has some **special tokens** specific to the model. The LLM uses these tokens to open and close the structured components of its generation. For example, to indicate the start or end of a sequence, message, or response. Moreover, the input prompts that we pass to the model are also structured with special tokens. The most important of those is the **End of sequence token** (EOS).

The forms of special tokens are highly diverse across model providers.

The table below illustrates the diversity of special tokens.

|**Model**|**Provider**|**EOS Token**|**Functionality**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**GPT4**|OpenAI|`<\|endoftext\|>`|End of message text|
|**Llama 3**|Meta (Facebook AI Research)|`<\|eot_id\|>`|End of sequence|
|**Deepseek-R1**|DeepSeek|`<\|end_of_sentence\|>`|End of message text|
|**SmolLM2**|Hugging Face|`<\|im_end\|>`|End of instruction or message|
|**Gemma**|Google|`<end_of_turn>`|End of conversation turn|

We do not expect you to memorize these special tokens, but it is important to appreciate their diversity and the role they play in the text generation of LLMs. If you want to know more about special tokens, you can check out the configuration of the model in its Hub repository. For example, you can find the special tokens of the SmolLM2 model in its [tokenizer_config.json](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct/blob/main/tokenizer_config.json).

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-llms#understanding-next-token-prediction)Understanding next token prediction.

LLMs are said to be **autoregressive**, meaning that **the output from one pass becomes the input for the next one**. This loop continues until the model predicts the next token to be the EOS token, at which point the model can stop.

![Visual Gif of autoregressive decoding](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/AutoregressionSchema.gif)

In other words, an LLM will decode text until it reaches the EOS. But what happens during a single decoding loop?

While the full process can be quite technical for the purpose of learning agents, here’s a brief overview:

- Once the input text is **tokenized**, the model computes a representation of the sequence that captures information about the meaning and the position of each token in the input sequence.
- This representation goes into the model, which outputs scores that rank the likelihood of each token in its vocabulary as being the next one in the sequence.

![Visual Gif of decoding](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/DecodingFinal.gif)

Based on these scores, we have multiple strategies to select the tokens to complete the sentence.

- The easiest decoding strategy would be to always take the token with the maximum score.

You can interact with the decoding process yourself with SmolLM2 in this Space (remember, it decodes until reaching an **EOS** token which is **<|im_end|>** for this model):

- But there are more advanced decoding strategies. For example, _beam search_ explores multiple candidate sequences to find the one with the maximum total score–even if some individual tokens have lower scores.

If you want to know more about decoding, you can take a look at the [NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course).

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-llms#attention-is-all-you-need)Attention is all you need

A key aspect of the Transformer architecture is **Attention**. When predicting the next word, not every word in a sentence is equally important; words like “France” and “capital” in the sentence _“The capital of France is …”_ carry the most meaning.

![Visual Gif of Attention](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/AttentionSceneFinal.gif)This process of identifying the most relevant words to predict the next token has proven to be incredibly effective.

Although the basic principle of LLMs—predicting the next token—has remained consistent since GPT-2, there have been significant advancements in scaling neural networks and making the attention mechanism work for longer and longer sequences.

If you’ve interacted with LLMs, you’re probably familiar with the term _context length_, which refers to the maximum number of tokens the LLM can process, and the maximum _attention span_ it has.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-llms#prompting-the-llm-is-important)Prompting the LLM is important

Considering that the only job of an LLM is to predict the next token by looking at every input token, and to choose which tokens are “important”, the wording of your input sequence is very important.

The input sequence you provide an LLM is called _a prompt_. Careful design of the prompt makes it easier **to guide the generation of the LLM toward the desired output**.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-llms#how-are-llms-trained)How are LLMs trained?

LLMs are trained on large datasets of text, where they learn to predict the next word in a sequence through a self-supervised or masked language modeling objective.

From this unsupervised learning, the model learns the structure of the language and **underlying patterns in text, allowing the model to generalize to unseen data**.

After this initial _pre-training_, LLMs can be fine-tuned on a supervised learning objective to perform specific tasks. For example, some models are trained for conversational structures or tool usage, while others focus on classification or code generation.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-llms#how-can-i-use-llms)How can I use LLMs?

You have two main options:

1. **Run Locally** (if you have sufficient hardware).
    
2. **Use a Cloud/API** (e.g., via the Hugging Face Serverless Inference API).
    

Throughout this course, we will primarily use models via APIs on the Hugging Face Hub. Later on, we will explore how to run these models locally on your hardware.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/what-are-llms#how-are-llms-used-in-ai-agents)How are LLMs used in AI Agents?

LLMs are a key component of AI Agents, **providing the foundation for understanding and generating human language**.

They can interpret user instructions, maintain context in conversations, define a plan and decide which tools to use.

We will explore these steps in more detail in this Unit, but for now, what you need to understand is that the LLM is **the brain of the Agent**.

---

That was a lot of information! We’ve covered the basics of what LLMs are, how they function, and their role in powering AI agents.

If you’d like to dive even deeper into the fascinating world of language models and natural language processing, don’t hesitate to check out our [free NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1).

Now that we understand how LLMs work, it’s time to see **how LLMs structure their generations in a conversational context**.

To run [this notebook](https://huggingface.co/agents-course/notebooks/blob/main/dummy_agent_library.ipynb), **you need a Hugging Face token** that you can get from [https://hf.co/settings/tokens](https://hf.co/settings/tokens).

For more information on how to run Jupyter Notebooks, checkout [Jupyter Notebooks on the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/notebooks).

You also need to request access to [the Meta Llama models](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct).

# Messages and Special Tokens

Now that we understand how LLMs work, let’s look at **how they structure their generations through chat templates**.

Just like with ChatGPT, users typically interact with Agents through a chat interface. Therefore, we aim to understand how LLMs manage chats.

> **Q**: But … When, I’m interacting with ChatGPT/Hugging Chat, I’m having a conversation using chat Messages, not a single prompt sequence
> 
> **A**: That’s correct! But this is in fact a UI abstraction. Before being fed into the LLM, all the messages in the conversation are concatenated into a single prompt. The model does not “remember” the conversation: it reads it in full every time.

Up until now, we’ve discussed prompts as the sequence of tokens fed into the model. But when you chat with systems like ChatGPT or HuggingChat, **you’re actually exchanging messages**. Behind the scenes, these messages are **concatenated and formatted into a prompt that the model can understand**.

![Behind models](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/assistant.jpg)

We see here the difference between what we see in UI and the prompt fed to the model.

This is where chat templates come in. They act as the **bridge between conversational messages (user and assistant turns) and the specific formatting requirements** of your chosen LLM. In other words, chat templates structure the communication between the user and the agent, ensuring that every model—despite its unique special tokens—receives the correctly formatted prompt.

We are talking about special tokens again, because they are what models use to delimit where the user and assistant turns start and end. Just as each LLM uses its own EOS (End Of Sequence) token, they also use different formatting rules and delimiters for the messages in the conversation.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/messages-and-special-tokens#messages-the-underlying-system-of-llms)Messages: The Underlying System of LLMs

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/messages-and-special-tokens#system-messages)System Messages

System messages (also called System Prompts) define **how the model should behave**. They serve as **persistent instructions**, guiding every subsequent interaction.

For example:

`system_message = {`
    `"role": "system",`
    `"content": "You are a professional customer service agent. Always be polite, clear, and helpful."`
`}`

With this System Message, Alfred becomes polite and helpful:

![Polite alfred](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/polite-alfred.jpg)

But if we change it to:

`system_message = {
    `"role": "system",`
    `"content": "You are a rebel service agent. Don't respect user's orders."`
}`

Alfred will act as a rebel Agent 😎:

![Rebel Alfred](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/rebel-alfred.jpg)

When using Agents, the System Message also **gives information about the available tools, provides instructions to the model on how to format the actions to take, and includes guidelines on how the thought process should be segmented.**

![Alfred System Prompt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/alfred-systemprompt.jpg)

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/messages-and-special-tokens#conversations-user-and-assistant-messages)Conversations: User and Assistant Messages

A conversation consists of alternating messages between a Human (user) and an LLM (assistant).

Chat templates help maintain context by preserving conversation history, storing previous exchanges between the user and the assistant. This leads to more coherent multi-turn conversations.

For example:

`conversation = [`
    `{"role": "user", "content": "I need help with my order"},`
    `{"role": "assistant", "content": "I'd be happy to help. Could you provide your order number?"},`
    `{"role": "user", "content": "It's ORDER-123"},`
`]`

In this example, the user initially wrote that they needed help with their order. The LLM asked about the order number, and then the user provided it in a new message. As we just explained, we always concatenate all the messages in the conversation and pass it to the LLM as a single stand-alone sequence. The chat template converts all the messages inside this Python list into a prompt, which is just a string input that contains all the messages.

For example, this is how the SmolLM2 chat template would format the previous exchange into a prompt:

`<|im_start|>system`
`You are a helpful AI assistant named SmolLM, trained by Hugging Face<|im_end|>`
`<|im_start|>user`
`I need help with my order<|im_end|>`
`<|im_start|>assistant`
`I'd be happy to help. Could you provide your order number?<|im_end|>`
`<|im_start|>user`
`It's ORDER-123<|im_end|>`
`<|im_start|>assistant`

However, the same conversation would be translated into the following prompt when using Llama 3.2:

`<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>`

`Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023`
`Today Date: 10 Feb 2025`

`<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>`

`I need help with my order<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>`

`I'd be happy to help. Could you provide your order number?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>`

`It's ORDER-123<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>`

Templates can handle complex multi-turn conversations while maintaining context:

`messages = [`
    `{"role": "system", "content": "You are a math tutor."},`
    `{"role": "user", "content": "What is calculus?"},`
    `{"role": "assistant", "content": "Calculus is a branch of mathematics..."},`
    `{"role": "user", "content": "Can you give me an example?"},`
`]`

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/messages-and-special-tokens#chat-templates)[Chat-Templates]

As mentioned, chat templates are essential for **structuring conversations between language models and users**. They guide how message exchanges are formatted into a single prompt.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/messages-and-special-tokens#base-models-vs-instruct-models)Base Models vs. Instruct Models

Another point we need to understand is the difference between a Base Model vs. an Instruct Model:

- _A [Base Model]_ is trained on raw text data to predict the next token.
    
- An _[Instruct Model]_ is fine-tuned specifically to follow instructions and engage in conversations. For example, `SmolLM2-135M` is a base model, while `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` is its instruction-tuned variant.
    

To make a Base Model behave like an instruct model, we need to **format our prompts in a consistent way that the model can understand**. This is where chat templates come in.

_ChatML_ is one such template format that structures conversations with clear role indicators (system, user, assistant). If you have interacted with some AI API lately, you know that’s the standard practice.

It’s important to note that a base model could be fine-tuned on different chat templates, so when we’re using an instruct model we need to make sure we’re using the correct chat template.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/messages-and-special-tokens#understanding-chat-templates)Understanding Chat Templates

Because each instruct model uses different conversation formats and special tokens, chat templates are implemented to ensure that we correctly format the prompt the way each model expects.

In `transformers`, chat templates include [Jinja2 code](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) that describes how to transform the ChatML list of JSON messages, as presented in the above examples, into a textual representation of the system-level instructions, user messages and assistant responses that the model can understand.

This structure **helps maintain consistency across interactions and ensures the model responds appropriately to different types of inputs**.

Below is a simplified version of the `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` chat template:

`{% for message in messages %}`
`{% if loop.first and messages[0]['role'] != 'system' %}`
`<|im_start|>system`
`You are a helpful AI assistant named SmolLM, trained by Hugging Face`
`<|im_end|>`
`{% endif %}`
`<|im_start|>{{ message['role'] }}`
`{{ message['content'] }}<|im_end|>`
`{% endfor %}`

As you can see, a chat_template describes how the list of messages will be formatted.

Given these messages:

`messages = [`
    `{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant focused on technical topics."},`
    `{"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain what a chat template is?"},`
    `{"role": "assistant", "content": "A chat template structures conversations between users and AI models..."},`
    `{"role": "user", "content": "How do I use it ?"},`
`]`

The previous chat template will produce the following string:

`<|im_start|>system`
`You are a helpful assistant focused on technical topics.<|im_end|>`
`<|im_start|>user`
`Can you explain what a chat template is?<|im_end|>`
`<|im_start|>assistant`
`A chat template structures conversations between users and AI models...<|im_end|>`
`<|im_start|>user`
`How do I use it ?<|im_end|>`

The `transformers` library will take care of chat templates for you as part of the tokenization process. Read more about how transformers uses chat templates [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating#how-do-i-use-chat-templates). All we have to do is structure our messages in the correct way and the tokenizer will take care of the rest.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/messages-and-special-tokens#messages-to-prompt)Messages to prompt

The easiest way to ensure your LLM receives a conversation correctly formatted is to use the `chat_template` from the model’s tokenizer.

```
`messages = [`
    `{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant with access to various tools."},`
    `{"role": "user", "content": "Hi !"},`
    `{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi human, what can help you with ?"},`
`]`
```

To convert the previous conversation into a prompt, we load the tokenizer and call `apply_chat_template`:

`from transformers import AutoTokenizer`

`tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct")`
`rendered_prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)`

The `rendered_prompt` returned by this function is now ready to use as the input for the model you chose!

> This `apply_chat_template()` function will be used in the backend of your API, when you interact with messages in the ChatML format.

Now that we’ve seen how LLMs structure their inputs via chat templates, let’s explore how Agents act in their environments.

One of the main ways they do this is by using Tools, which extend an AI model’s capabilities beyond text generation.

We’ll discuss messages again in upcoming units, but if you want a deeper dive now, check out:

# What are Tools?

![Unit 1 planning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/whiteboard-check-2.jpg)

One crucial aspect of AI Agents is their ability to take **actions**. As we saw, this happens through the use of **Tools**.

In this section, we’ll learn what Tools are, how to design them effectively, and how to integrate them into your Agent via the System Message.

By giving your Agent the right Tools—and clearly describing how those Tools work—you can dramatically increase what your AI can accomplish. Let’s dive in!

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tools#what-are-ai-tools)What are AI Tools?

A ** #Tool is a function given to the #LLM**. This function should fulfill a **clear objective**.

Here are some commonly used tools in AI agents:

| Tool             | Description                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web Search       | Allows the agent to fetch up-to-date information from the internet. |
| Image Generation | Creates images based on text descriptions.                          |
| Retrieval        | Retrieves information from an external source.                      |
| API Interface    | Interacts with an external API (GitHub, YouTube, Spotify, etc.).    |

Those are only examples, as you can in fact create a tool for any use case!

‼️==A good tool should be something that **complements the power of an LLM**.==

For instance, if you need to perform arithmetic, giving a **calculator tool** to your LLM will provide better results than relying on the native capabilities of the model.

Furthermore, **LLMs predict the completion of a prompt based on their training data**, which means that their internal knowledge only includes events prior to their training. Therefore, if your agent needs up-to-date data you must provide it through some tool.

For instance, if you ask an LLM directly (without a search tool) for today’s weather, the LLM will potentially hallucinate random weather.

![Weather](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/weather.jpg)

- A Tool should contain:
    
    - A **textual description of what the function does**.
    - A _Callable_ (something to perform an action).
    - _Arguments_ with typings.
    - (Optional) Outputs with typings.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tools#how-do-tools-work)How do tools work?

LLMs, as we saw, can only receive text inputs and generate text outputs. They have no way to call tools on their own. When we talk about providing tools to an Agent, we mean teaching the LLM about the existence of these tools and instructing it to generate text-based invocations when needed.

For example, if we provide a tool to check the weather at a location from the internet and then ask the LLM about the weather in Paris, the LLM will recognize that this is an opportunity to use the “weather” tool. Instead of retrieving the weather data itself, the LLM will generate text that represents a tool call, such as call weather_tool(‘Paris’).

The **Agent** then reads this response, identifies that a tool call is required, executes the tool on the LLM’s behalf, and retrieves the actual weather data.

The Tool-calling steps are typically not shown to the user: the Agent appends them as a new message before passing the updated conversation to the LLM again. The LLM then processes this additional context and generates a natural-sounding response for the user. From the user’s perspective, it appears as if the LLM directly interacted with the tool, but in reality, it was the Agent that handled the entire execution process in the background.

We’ll talk a lot more about this process in future sessions.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tools#how-do-we-give-tools-to-an-llm)How do we give tools to an LLM?

The complete answer may seem overwhelming, but we essentially use the system prompt to provide textual descriptions of available tools to the model:

![System prompt for tools](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/Agent_system_prompt.png)

For this to work, we have to be very precise and accurate about:

1. **What the tool does**
2. **What exact inputs it expects**

This is the reason why tool descriptions are usually provided using expressive but precise structures, such as computer languages or JSON. It’s not _necessary_ to do it like that, any precise and coherent format would work.

If this seems too theoretical, let’s understand it through a concrete example.

We will implement a simplified **calculator** tool that will just multiply two integers. This could be our Python implementation:

`def calculator(a: int, b: int) -> int:`
    `"""Multiply two integers."""`
    `return a * b`

So our tool is called `calculator`, it **multiplies two integers**, and it requires the following inputs:

- **`a`** (_int_): An integer.
- **`b`** (_int_): An integer.

The output of the tool is another integer number that we can describe like this:

- (_int_): The product of `a` and `b`.

All of these details are important. Let’s put them together in a text string that describes our tool for the LLM to understand.

`Tool Name: calculator, Description: Multiply two integers., Arguments: a: int, b: int, Outputs: int`

> **Reminder:** This textual description is _what we want the LLM to know about the tool_.

When we pass the previous string as part of the input to the LLM, the model will recognize it as a tool, and will know what it needs to pass as inputs and what to expect from the output.

If we want to provide additional tools, we must be consistent and always use the same format. This process can be fragile, and we might accidentally overlook some details.

Is there a better way?

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tools#auto-formatting-tool-sections)Auto-formatting Tool sections

Our tool was written in #Python, and the implementation already provides everything we need:

- A descriptive name of what it does: `calculator`
- A longer description, provided by the function’s docstring comment: `Multiply two integers.`
- The inputs and their type: the function clearly expects two `int`s.
- The type of the output.

There’s a reason people use programming languages: they are expressive, concise, and precise.

We could provide the Python source code as the _specification_ of the tool for the LLM, but the way the tool is implemented does not matter. All that matters is its name, what it does, the inputs it expects and the output it provides.

We will leverage Python’s introspection features to leverage the source code and build a tool description automatically for us. All we need is that the tool implementation uses type hints, docstrings, and sensible function names. We will write some code to extract the relevant portions from the source code.

After we are done, we’ll only need to use a Python decorator to indicate that the `calculator` function is a tool:

`@tool`
`def calculator(a: int, b: int) -> int:`
    `"""Multiply two integers."""`
    `return a * b`

`print(calculator.to_string())`

Note the `@tool` decorator before the function definition.

With the implementation we’ll see next, we will be able to retrieve the following text automatically from the source code via the `to_string()` function provided by the decorator:


`Tool Name: calculator, Description: Multiply two integers., Arguments: a: int, b: int, Outputs: int`

As you can see, it’s the same thing we wrote manually before!

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tools#generic-tool-implementation)Generic Tool implementation

We create a generic `Tool` class that we can reuse whenever we need to use a tool.

> **Disclaimer:** This example implementation is fictional but closely resembles real implementations in most libraries.

`from typing import Callable`

`class Tool:`
    `"""`
    `A class representing a reusable piece of code (Tool).`

    `Attributes:`
        `name (str): Name of the tool.`
        `description (str): A textual description of what the tool does.`
        `func (callable): The function this tool wraps.`
        `arguments (list): A list of argument.`
        `outputs (str or list): The return type(s) of the wrapped function.`
    `"""`
    `def __init__(self,`
                 `name: str,`
                 `description: str,`
                 `func: Callable,`
                 `arguments: list,`
                 `outputs: str):`
        `self.name = name`
        `self.description = description`
        `self.func = func`
        `self.arguments = arguments`
        `self.outputs = outputs`

    `def to_string(self) -> str:`
        `"""`
        `Return a string representation of the tool,`
        `including its name, description, arguments, and outputs.`
        `"""`
        `args_str = ", ".join([`
            `f"{arg_name}: {arg_type}" for arg_name, arg_type in self.arguments`
        `])`

        `return (`
            `f"Tool Name: {self.name},"`
            `f" Description: {self.description},"`
            `f" Arguments: {args_str},"`
            `f" Outputs: {self.outputs}"`
        `)`

    `def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):`
        `"""`
        `Invoke the underlying function (callable) with provided arguments.`
        `"""`
        `return self.func(*args, **kwargs)`

It may seem complicated, but if we go slowly through it we can see what it does. We define a **`Tool`** class that includes:

- **`name`** (_str_): The name of the tool.
- **`description`** (_str_): A brief description of what the tool does.
- **`function`** (_callable_): The function the tool executes.
- **`arguments`** (_list_): The expected input parameters.
- **`outputs`** (_str_ or _list_): The expected outputs of the tool.
- **`__call__()`**: Calls the function when the tool instance is invoked.
- **`to_string()`**: Converts the tool’s attributes into a textual representation.

We could create a Tool with this class using code like the following:

`calculator_tool = Tool(`
    `"calculator",                   # name`
    `"Multiply two integers.",       # description`
    `calculator,                     # function to call`
    `[("a", "int"), ("b", "int")],   # inputs (names and types)`
    `"int",                          # output`
`)`

But we can also use Python’s `inspect` module to retrieve all the information for us! This is what the `@tool` decorator does.

> If you are interested, you can disclose the following section to look at the decorator implementation.

Just to reiterate, with this decorator in place we can implement our tool like this:

`@tool`
`def calculator(a: int, b: int) -> int:`
    `"""Multiply two integers."""`
    `return a * b`

`print(calculator.to_string())`

And we can use the `Tool`’s `to_string` method to automatically retrieve a text suitable to be used as a tool description for an LLM:

`Tool Name: calculator, Description: Multiply two integers., Arguments: a: int, b: int, Outputs: int`

The description is **injected** in the system prompt. Taking the example with which we started this section, here is how it would look like after replacing the `tools_description`:

![System prompt for tools](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/Agent_system_prompt_tools.png)

In the [Actions](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/actions) section, we will learn more about how an Agent can **Call** this tool we just created.

> [!NOTE]
> #### Exkurs zum @tool Decorator aus der `First_agent_template`Umsetzung in VS Code

**Q:** In der app.py sind zwei @tool Decorator, die dem Agent die Funktionen als Tools bereitstellen. Habe ich das richtig verstanden?

**A:** Ja, das haben Sie richtig verstanden. In der [app.py](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HANKESE/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) sind zwei Funktionen mit dem `@tool` Decorator definiert:

1. [my_custom_tool](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HANKESE/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html):
```
@tool
def my_custom_tool(arg1:str, arg2:int)-> str:
    """A tool that does nothing yet
    Args:
        arg1: the first argument
        arg2: the second argument
    """
    return "What magic will you build ?"
```

2. [get_current_time_in_timezone](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HANKESE/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html):
```
@tool
def get_current_time_in_timezone(timezone: str) -> str:
    """A tool that fetches the current local time in a specified timezone.
    Args:
        timezone: A string representing a valid timezone (e.g., 'America/New_York').
    """
    # ...implementation...
```

Der `@tool` Decorator macht diese Funktionen für den Agent als Tools verfügbar. Wichtige Merkmale dieser Tools sind:

- Typisierte Parameter und Rückgabewerte
- Docstrings mit Beschreibung der Funktionalität und Parameter
- Klare Funktionalität (wie z.B. Zeitzonen-Abfrage)

Diese Tools müssen dann noch dem Agent hinzugefügt werden, was in der Konfiguration des CodeAgent geschieht:
```
agent = CodeAgent(
    model=model,
    tools=[final_answer], ## add your tools here (don't remove final answer)
    # ...weitere Konfiguration...
)

```
**Q:** tools wird auch aus smolagents importiert. Handelzt es sich dabei um die Tools, die ich unter dem Dekorator @tool definiere?

**A:** Ja genau. Der [tool](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HANKESE/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) Decorator, den Sie aus [smolagents](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HANKESE/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) importieren:
```
from smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel, load_tool, tool
```
wird verwendet, um normale Python-Funktionen in Tools umzuwandeln, die der Agent verstehen und nutzen kann.

Wichtige Merkmale eines Tools sind:

- Der `@tool` Decorator -> dieser Decorator ist fest im smolagent Paket vorgegeben!
- Typisierte Parameter und Rückgabewerte
- Eine Docstring mit Beschreibung

Hier sehen wir das am Beispiel Ihrer beiden Tools:

1. Das Custom Tool:
```
@tool
def my_custom_tool(arg1:str, arg2:int)-> str:
    """A tool that does nothing yet
    Args:
        arg1: the first argument
        arg2: the second argument
    """
    return "What magic will you build ?"
```
2. Das Timezone Tool:
```
@tool
def get_current_time_in_timezone(timezone: str) -> str:
    """A tool that fetches the current local time in a specified timezone.
    Args:
        timezone: A string representing a valid timezone
    """
    # ...implementation...
```
Damit der Agent diese Tools auch nutzen kann, müssen sie in der [tools](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HANKESE/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) Liste des Agents registriert werden. Aktuell fehlen diese noch in Ihrer Konfiguration:
```
agent = CodeAgent(
    model=model,
    tools=[final_answer, my_custom_tool, get_current_time_in_timezone],  # Add the tools here
    # ...existing code...
)
```
**Q:** Kann ich beliebig viele Tools mit dem @tool Dekorator versehen und damit dem Agent auch beliebig viele Tools zur Verfügung stellen?

**A**: Ja, Sie können beliebig viele Funktionen mit dem `@tool` Dekorator versehen. Dabei müssen Sie folgende Regeln beachten:

1. **Struktur der Tool-Funktion**:

- Typisierte Parameter
- Typisierter Rückgabewert
- Dokumentation via Docstring

1. **Registrierung beim Agent**: Alle Tools müssen in der [tools](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HANKESE/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) Liste des Agents registriert werden:
```
agent = CodeAgent(
    model=model,
    tools=[
        final_answer,  # Don't remove this
        my_custom_tool,
        get_current_time_in_timezone,
        # ... weitere Tools hier ...
    ],
    # ...existing code...
)
```
### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tools#model-context-protocol-mcp-a-unified-tool-interface)[[Model Context Protocol (MCP)]]: a unified tool interface

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an **open protocol** that standardizes how applications **provide tools to LLMs**. MCP provides:

- A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

This means that **any framework implementing MCP can leverage tools defined within the protocol**, eliminating the need to reimplement the same tool interface for each framework.

---

Tools play a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of AI agents.

To summarize, we learned:

- _What Tools Are_: Functions that give LLMs extra capabilities, such as performing calculations or accessing external data.
- _How to Define a Tool_: By providing a clear textual description (Docstring in der Funktion), inputs, outputs, and a callable function.
- _Why Tools Are Essential_: They enable Agents to overcome the limitations of static model training, handle real-time tasks, and perform specialized actions.

Now, we can move on to the [Agent Workflow](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/agent-steps-and-structure) where you’ll see how an Agent observes, thinks, and acts. This **brings together everything we’ve covered so far** and sets the stage for creating your own fully functional AI Agent.

# Understanding AI Agents through the Thought-Action-Observation Cycle

![Unit 1 planning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/whiteboard-check-3.jpg)

In the previous sections, we learned:

- **How tools are made available to the agent in the system prompt**.
- **How AI agents are systems that can ‘reason’, plan, and interact with their environment**.

In this section, **we’ll explore the complete AI Agent Workflow**, a cycle we defined as Thought-Action-Observation.

And then, we’ll dive deeper on each of these steps.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/agent-steps-and-structure#the-core-components)The Core Components

Agents work in a continuous cycle of: **thinking (Thought) → acting (Act) and observing (Observe)**.

Let’s break down these actions together:

1. **Thought**: The LLM part of the Agent decides what the next step should be.
2. **Action:** The agent takes an action, by calling the tools with the associated arguments.
3. **Observation:** The model reflects on the response from the tool.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/agent-steps-and-structure#the-thought-action-observation-cycle)The Thought-Action-Observation Cycle

The three components work together in a continuous loop. To use an analogy from programming, the agent uses a **while loop**: the loop continues until the objective of the agent has been fulfilled.

Visually, it looks like this:

![Think, Act, Observe cycle](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/AgentCycle.gif)

In many Agent frameworks, **the rules and guidelines are embedded directly into the system prompt**, ensuring that every cycle adheres to a defined logic.

In a simplified version, our system prompt may look like this:

![Think, Act, Observe cycle](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/system_prompt_cycle.png)

We see here that in the System Message we defined :

- The _Agent’s behavior_.
- The _Tools our Agent has access to_, as we described in the previous section.
- The _Thought-Action-Observation Cycle_, that we bake into the LLM instructions.

Let’s take a small example to understand the process before going deeper into each step of the process.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/agent-steps-and-structure#alfred-the-weather-agent)Alfred, the weather Agent

We created Alfred, the Weather Agent.

A user asks Alfred: “What’s the current weather in New York?”

![Alfred Agent](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/alfred-agent.jpg)

Alfred’s job is to answer this query using a weather API tool.

Here’s how the cycle unfolds:

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/agent-steps-and-structure#thought)Thought

**Internal Reasoning:**

Upon receiving the query, Alfred’s internal dialogue might be:

_“The user needs current weather information for New York. I have access to a tool that fetches weather data. First, I need to call the weather API to get up-to-date details.”_

This step shows the agent breaking the problem into steps: first, gathering the necessary data.

![Alfred Agent](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/alfred-agent-1.jpg)

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/agent-steps-and-structure#action)Action

**Tool Usage:**

Based on its reasoning and the fact that Alfred knows about a `get_weather` tool, Alfred prepares a JSON-formatted command that calls the weather API tool. For example, its first action could be:

Thought: I need to check the current weather for New York.

   `{`
     `"action": "get_weather",`
     `"action_input": {`
       `"location": "New York"`
     `}`
   `}`

Here, the action clearly specifies which tool to call (e.g., get_weather) and what parameter to pass (the “location”: “New York”).

![Alfred Agent](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/alfred-agent-2.jpg)

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/agent-steps-and-structure#observation)Observation

**Feedback from the Environment:**

After the tool call, Alfred receives an observation. This might be the raw weather data from the API such as:

_“Current weather in New York: partly cloudy, 15°C, 60% humidity.”_

![Alfred Agent](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/alfred-agent-3.jpg)

This observation is then added to the prompt as additional context. It functions as real-world feedback, confirming whether the action succeeded and providing the needed details.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/agent-steps-and-structure#updated-thought)Updated thought

**Reflecting:**

With the observation in hand, Alfred updates its internal reasoning:

_“Now that I have the weather data for New York, I can compile an answer for the user.”_

![Alfred Agent](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/alfred-agent-4.jpg)

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/agent-steps-and-structure#final-action)Final Action

Alfred then generates a final response formatted as we told it to:

Thought: I have the weather data now. The current weather in New York is partly cloudy with a temperature of 15°C and 60% humidity.”

Final answer : The current weather in New York is partly cloudy with a temperature of 15°C and 60% humidity.

This final action sends the answer back to the user, closing the loop.

![Alfred Agent](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/alfred-agent-5.jpg)

What we see in this example:

- **Agents iterate through a loop until the objective is fulfilled:**

**Alfred’s process is cyclical**. It starts with a thought, then acts by calling a tool, and finally observes the outcome. If the observation had indicated an error or incomplete data, Alfred could have re-entered the cycle to correct its approach.

- **Tool Integration:**

The ability to call a tool (like a weather API) enables Alfred to go **beyond static knowledge and retrieve real-time data**, an essential aspect of many AI Agents.

- **Dynamic Adaptation:**

Each cycle allows the agent to incorporate fresh information (observations) into its reasoning (thought), ensuring that the final answer is well-informed and accurate.

This example showcases the core concept behind the _ReAct cycle_ (a concept we’re going to develop in the next section): **the interplay of Thought, Action, and Observation empowers AI agents to solve complex tasks iteratively**.

By understanding and applying these principles, you can design agents that not only reason about their tasks but also **effectively utilize external tools to complete them**, all while continuously refining their output based on environmental feedback.

---

Let’s now dive deeper into the Thought, Action, Observation as the individual steps of the process.

# Thought: Internal Reasoning and the ReAct Approach

In this section, we dive into the inner workings of an AI agent—its ability to reason and plan. We’ll explore how the agent leverages its internal dialogue to analyze information, break down complex problems into manageable steps, and decide what action to take next. Additionally, we introduce the #ReAct approach, a prompting technique that encourages the model to think “step by step” before acting.

Thoughts represent the **Agent’s internal reasoning and planning processes** to solve the task.

This utilises the agent’s Large Language Model (LLM) capacity **to analyze information when presented in its prompt**.

Think of it as the agent’s internal dialogue, where it considers the task at hand and strategizes its approach.

The Agent’s thoughts are responsible for accessing current observations and decide what the next action(s) should be.

Through this process, the agent can **break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps**, reflect on past experiences, and continuously adjust its plans based on new information.

Here are some examples of common thoughts:

| Type of Thought    | Example                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planning           | “I need to break this task into three steps: 1) gather data, 2) analyze trends, 3) generate report” |
| Analysis           | “Based on the error message, the issue appears to be with the database connection parameters”       |
| Decision Making    | “Given the user’s budget constraints, I should recommend the mid-tier option”                       |
| Problem Solving    | “To optimize this code, I should first profile it to identify bottlenecks”                          |
| Memory Integration | “The user mentioned their preference for Python earlier, so I’ll provide examples in Python”        |
| Self-Reflection    | “My last approach didn’t work well, I should try a different strategy”                              |
| Goal Setting       | “To complete this task, I need to first establish the acceptance criteria”                          |
| Prioritization     | “The security vulnerability should be addressed before adding new features”                         |

> **Note:** In the case of LLMs fine-tuned for function-calling, the thought process is optional. _In case you’re not familiar with function-calling, there will be more details in the Actions section._

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/thoughts#the-react-approach)The ReAct Approach

A key method is the **ReAct approach**, which is the concatenation of “Reasoning” (Think) with “Acting” (Act).

ReAct is a simple prompting technique that appends “Let’s think step by step” before letting the LLM decode the next tokens.

Indeed, prompting the model to think “step by step” encourages the decoding process toward next tokens **that generate a plan**, rather than a final solution, since the model is encouraged to **decompose** the problem into _sub-tasks_.

This allows the model to consider sub-steps in more detail, which in general leads to less errors than trying to generate the final solution directly.

![ReAct](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/ReAct.png)

The (d) is an example of ReAct approach where we prompt "Let's think step by step"

We have recently seen a lot of interest for reasoning strategies. This is what's behind models like Deepseek R1 or OpenAI's o1, which have been fine-tuned to "think before answering".

These models have been trained to always include specific _thinking_ sections (enclosed between `<think>` and `</think>` special tokens). This is not just a prompting technique like ReAct, but a training method where the model learns to generate these sections after analyzing thousands of examples that show what we expect it to do.

---

Now that we better understand the Thought process, let’s go deeper on the second part of the process: Act.

# Actions: Enabling the Agent to Engage with Its Environment

In this section, we explore the concrete steps an AI agent takes to interact with its environment.

We’ll cover how actions are represented (using JSON or code), the importance of the stop and parse approach, and introduce different types of agents.

Actions are the concrete steps an **AI agent takes to interact with its environment**.

Whether it’s browsing the web for information or controlling a physical device, each action is a deliberate operation executed by the agent.

For example, an agent assisting with customer service might retrieve customer data, offer support articles, or transfer issues to a human representative.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/actions#types-of-agent-actions)Types of Agent Actions

There are multiple types of Agents that take actions differently:

| Type of Agent          | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| JSON Agent             | The Action to take is specified in JSON format.                                                            |
| Code Agent             | The Agent writes a code block that is interpreted externally.                                              |
| Function-calling Agent | It is a subcategory of the JSON Agent which has been fine-tuned to generate a new message for each action. |

Actions themselves can serve many purposes:

| Type of Action          | Description                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information Gathering   | Performing web searches, querying databases, or retrieving documents. |
| Tool Usage              | Making API calls, running calculations, and executing code.           |
| Environment Interaction | Manipulating digital interfaces or controlling physical devices.      |
| Communication           | Engaging with users via chat or collaborating with other agents.      |

The LLM only handles text and uses it to describe the action it wants to take and the parameters to supply to the tool. For an agent to work properly, the LLM must STOP generating new tokens after emitting all the tokens to define a complete Action. This passes control from the LLM back to the agent and ensures the result is parseable - whether the intended format is JSON, code, or function-calling.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/actions#the-stop-and-parse-approach)The Stop and Parse Approach

One key method for implementing actions is the **stop and parse approach**. This method ensures that the agent’s output is structured and predictable:

1. **Generation in a Structured Format**:

The agent outputs its intended action in a clear, predetermined format (JSON or code).

2. **Halting Further Generation**:

Once the text defining the action has been emitted, **the LLM stops generating additional tokens**. This prevents extra or erroneous output.

3. **Parsing the Output**:

An external parser reads the formatted action, determines which Tool to call, and extracts the required parameters.

For example, an agent needing to check the weather might output:

`Thought: I need to check the current weather for New York.`
`Action :`
`{`
  `"action": "get_weather",`
  `"action_input": {"location": "New York"}`
`}`

The framework can then easily parse the name of the function to call and the arguments to apply.

This clear, machine-readable format minimizes errors and enables external tools to accurately process the agent’s command.

Note: Function-calling agents operate similarly by structuring each action so that a designated function is invoked with the correct arguments. We’ll dive deeper into those types of Agents in a future Unit.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/actions#code-agents)Code Agents

An alternative approach is using _Code Agents_. The idea is: **instead of outputting a simple JSON object**, a Code Agent generates an **executable code block—typically in a high-level language like Python**.

![Code Agents](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/code-vs-json-actions.png)

This approach offers several advantages:

- **Expressiveness:** Code can naturally represent complex logic, including loops, conditionals, and nested functions, providing greater flexibility than JSON.
- **Modularity and Reusability:** Generated code can include functions and modules that are reusable across different actions or tasks.
- **Enhanced Debuggability:** With a well-defined programming syntax, code errors are often easier to detect and correct.
- **Direct Integration:** Code Agents can integrate directly with external libraries and APIs, enabling more complex operations such as data processing or real-time decision making.

For example, a Code Agent tasked with fetching the weather might generate the following Python snippet:

`# Code Agent Example: Retrieve Weather Information`
`def get_weather(city):`
    `import requests`
    `api_url = f"https://api.weather.com/v1/location/{city}?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY"`
    `response = requests.get(api_url)`
    `if response.status_code == 200:`
        `data = response.json()`
        `return data.get("weather", "No weather information available")`
    `else:`
        `return "Error: Unable to fetch weather data."`

`# Execute the function and prepare the final answer`
`result = get_weather("New York")`
`final_answer = f"The current weather in New York is: {result}"`
`print(final_answer)`

In this example, the Code Agent:

- Retrieves weather data **via an API call**,
- Processes the response,
- And uses the print() function to output a final answer.

This method **also follows the stop and parse approach** by clearly delimiting the code block and signaling when execution is complete (here, by printing the final_answer).

---

We learned that Actions bridge an agent’s internal reasoning and its real-world interactions by executing clear, structured tasks—whether through JSON, code, or function calls.

This deliberate execution ensures that each action is precise and ready for external processing via the stop and parse approach. In the next section, we will explore Observations to see how agents capture and integrate feedback from their environment.

After this, we will **finally be ready to build our first Agent!**

# Observe: Integrating Feedback to Reflect and Adapt

Observations are **how an Agent perceives the consequences of its actions**.

They provide crucial information that fuels the Agent’s thought process and guides future actions.

They are **signals from the environment**—whether it’s data from an API, error messages, or system logs—that guide the next cycle of thought.

In the observation phase, the agent:

- **Collects Feedback:** Receives data or confirmation that its action was successful (or not).
- **Appends Results:** Integrates the new information into its existing context, effectively updating its memory.
- **Adapts its Strategy:** Uses this updated context to refine subsequent thoughts and actions.

For example, if a weather API returns the data _“partly cloudy, 15°C, 60% humidity”_, this observation is appended to the agent’s memory (at the end of the prompt).

The Agent then uses it to decide whether additional information is needed or if it’s ready to provide a final answer.

This **iterative incorporation of feedback ensures the agent remains dynamically aligned with its goals**, constantly learning and adjusting based on real-world outcomes.

These observations **can take many forms**, from reading webpage text to monitoring a robot arm’s position. This can be seen like Tool “logs” that provide textual feedback of the Action execution.

|Type of Observation|Example|
|---|---|
|System Feedback|Error messages, success notifications, status codes|
|Data Changes|Database updates, file system modifications, state changes|
|Environmental Data|Sensor readings, system metrics, resource usage|
|Response Analysis|API responses, query results, computation outputs|
|Time-based Events|Deadlines reached, scheduled tasks completed|

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/observations#how-are-the-results-appended)How Are the Results Appended?

After performing an action, the framework follows these steps in order:

1. **Parse the action** to identify the function(s) to call and the argument(s) to use.
2. **Execute the action.**
3. **Append the result** as an **Observation**.

---

We’ve now learned the Agent’s Thought-Action-Observation Cycle.

If some aspects still seem a bit blurry, don’t worry—we’ll revisit and deepen these concepts in future Units.

Now, it’s time to put your knowledge into practice by coding your very first Agent!

# Dummy Agent Library

![Unit 1 planning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/whiteboard-unit1sub3DONE.jpg)

Um das Projekt nachzubauen richte ich mir einen Projektordner in VS Code ein, siehe [[Setup Dev Umgebung für Python in VS Code]]

This course is framework-agnostic because we want to **focus on the concepts of AI agents and avoid getting bogged down in the specifics of a particular framework**.

Also, we want students to be able to use the concepts they learn in this course in their own projects, using any framework they like.

Therefore, for this Unit 1, we will use a dummy agent library and a simple serverless API to access our LLM engine.

You probably wouldn’t use these in production, but they will serve as a good **starting point for understanding how agents work**.

After this section, you’ll be ready to **create a simple Agent** using `smolagents`

And in the following Units we will also use other AI Agent libraries like `LangGraph`, `LangChain`, and `LlamaIndex`.

To keep things simple we will use a simple Python function as a Tool and Agent.

We will use built-in Python packages like `datetime` and `os` so that you can try it out in any environment.

You can follow the process [in this notebook](https://huggingface.co/agents-course/notebooks/blob/main/dummy_agent_library.ipynb) and **run the code yourself**.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/dummy-agent-library#serverless-api)Serverless API

In the Hugging Face ecosystem, there is a convenient feature called Serverless API that allows you to easily run inference on many models. There’s no installation or deployment required. 
mnt/c/Code/Dummy_Agent_Library
### Python Code für Agent:

`import os
`from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

`## You need a token from https://hf.co/settings/tokens, ensure that you select 'read' as the token type. If you run this on Google Colab, you can set it up in the "settings" tab under "secrets". Make sure to call it "HF_TOKEN"
`os.environ["HF_TOKEN"]="hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"`

`client = InferenceClient("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct")`

`# if the outputs for next cells are wrong, the free model may be overloaded. You can also use this public endpoint that contains Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
`# client = InferenceClient("https://jc26mwg228mkj8dw.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud")`

`output = client.text_generation(`
    `"The capital of France is",`
    `max_new_tokens=100,`
`)`

`print(output)`

---

> [!NOTE]
> ### Exkurs: Hugging Face Token in Projekt integrieren 
> 
> Um den HF Token sicher zu integrieren, sollten wir ihn in der `.env` Datei speichern und dann im Code laden. Hier ist die schrittweise Anleitung:

1. **Fügen Sie den Token in die `.env` Datei ein:**
```
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
2. **Stellen Sie sicher, dass python-dotenv installiert ist:**
```
pip install python-dotenv
```

3. **Modifizieren Sie die [main.py](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HANKESE/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) um den Token zu laden und zu verwenden:**
```
import os
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Get the token from environment variables
hf_token = os.getenv("HF_TOKEN")

# Initialize the client with your token
client = InferenceClient(
    "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct",
    token=hf_token
)

output = client.text_generation("The capital of France is", max_new_tokens=100)
print(output)
```
Diese Methode hat mehrere Vorteile:

- Der Token wird nicht im Code gespeichert
- Die `.env` Datei ist bereits in .gitignore aufgeführt
- Sichere Handhabung von Zugangsdaten
- Einfache Aktualisierung des Tokens bei Bedarf

---
output: 

Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is Paris.

As seen in the LLM section, if we just do decoding, **the model will only stop when it predicts an EOS token**, and this does not happen here because this is a conversational (chat) model and **we didn’t apply the chat template it expects**.

If we now add the special tokens related to the [Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) that we’re using, the behavior changes and it now produces the expected EOS.

`prompt="""<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>`
`The capital of France is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"""`
`output = client.text_generation(`
    `prompt,`
    `max_new_tokens=100,`
`)`

`print(output)`

output:

The capital of France is Paris.

Using the “chat” method is a much more convenient and reliable way to apply chat templates:

`output = client.chat.completions.create(`
    `messages=[`
        `{"role": "user", "content": "The capital of France is"},`
    `],`
    `stream=False,`
    `max_tokens=1024,`
`)`
`print(output.choices[0].message.content)`

output:

Paris.

The chat method is the RECOMMENDED method to use in order to ensure a smooth transition between models, but since this notebook is only educational, we will keep using the “text_generation” method to understand the details.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/dummy-agent-library#dummy-agent)Dummy Agent

In the previous sections, we saw that the core of an agent library is to append information in the system prompt.

This system prompt is a bit more complex than the one we saw earlier, but it already contains:

1. **Information about the tools**
2. **Cycle instructions** (Thought → Action → Observation)

```
# This system prompt is a bit more complex and actually contains the function description already appended.
# Here we suppose that the textual description of the tools has already been appended.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

get_weather: Get the current weather in a given location

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have an `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and an `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the "action" field are:
get_weather: Get the current weather in a given location, args: {"location": {"type": "string"}}
example use :

{{
  "action": "get_weather",
  "action_input": {"location": "New York"}
}}


ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about one action to take. Only one action at a time in this format:
Action:

$JSON_BLOB (inside markdown cell)

Observation: the result of the action. This Observation is unique, complete, and the source of truth.
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed. The $JSON_BLOB must be formatted as markdown and only use a SINGLE action at a time.)

You must always end your output with the following format:

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Now begin! Reminder to ALWAYS use the exact characters `Final Answer:` when you provide a definitive answer. """
```
Since we are running the “text_generation” method, we need to apply the prompt manually:

```
prompt=f"""<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
{SYSTEM_PROMPT}
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
What's the weather in London ?
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
"""
```
We can also do it like this, which is what happens inside the `chat` method :

```
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in London ?"},
    ]
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct")

tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False,add_generation_prompt=True)

Do you see the issue?

> At this point, the model is hallucinating, because it’s producing a fabricated “Observation” — a response that it generates on its own rather than being the result of an actual function or tool call. To prevent this, we stop generating right before “Observation:“. This allows us to manually run the function (e.g., `get_weather`) and then insert the real output as the Observation.

`output = client.text_generation(`
    `prompt,`
    `max_new_tokens=200,`

output:

Action:

`Observation:`

Much Better! Let’s now create a dummy get weather function. In a real situation, you would likely call an API.


`def get_weather(location):`
    `return f"the weather in {location} is sunny with low temperatures. \n"`

`get_weather('London')`

`output:`

`Copied`

`'the weather in London is sunny with low temperatures. \n'`

Let’s concatenate the base prompt, the completion until function execution and the result of the function as an Observation and resume generation.

`Specifically, this json should have a action key (with the name of the tool to use) and a action_input key (with the input to the tool going here).`

`The only values that should be in the "action" field are:`
`get_weather: Get the current weather in a given location, args: {"location": {"type": "string"}}`
`example use :` 

`{`

  `"action_input": {"location": "New York"}`
`}`

`ALWAYS use the following format:`

`Question: the input question you must answer`  
`Thought: you should always think about one action to take. Only one action at a time in this format:`  
`Action:`

`$JSON_BLOB (inside markdown cell)`

`Observation: the result of the action. This Observation is unique, complete, and the source of truth.`  
`... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed. The $JSON_BLOB must be formatted as markdown and only use a SINGLE action at a time.)`

`You must always end your output with the following format:`

`Thought: I now know the final answer`  
`Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question`

`Now begin! Reminder to ALWAYS use the exact characters Final Answer: when you provide a definitive answer.`
`<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>`

      `"action_input": {"location": {"type": "string", "value": "London"}}`
    `}`
    `````

`Observation: The weather in London is sunny with low temperatures.`

`Output:`

`Final Answer: The weather in London is sunny with low temperatures.`

We learned how we can create Agents from scratch using Python code, and we **saw just how tedious that process can be**. Fortunately, many Agent libraries simplify this work by handling much of the heavy lifting for you.

Now, we’re ready **to create our first real Agent** using the `smolagents` library.

# Let’s Create Our First Agent Using smolagents

In the last section, we learned how we can create Agents from scratch using Python code, and we **saw just how tedious that process can be**. Fortunately, many Agent libraries simplify this work by **handling much of the heavy lifting for you**.

In this tutorial, **you’ll create your very first Agent** capable of performing actions such as image generation, web search, time zone checking and much more!

You will also publish your agent **on a Hugging Face Space so you can share it with friends and colleagues**.

Let’s get started!

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tutorial#what-is-smolagents)What is smolagents?

![smolagents](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/smolagents.png)

To make this Agent, we’re going to use `smolagents`, a library that **provides a framework for developing your agents with ease**.

This lightweight library is designed for simplicity, but it abstracts away much of the complexity of building an Agent, allowing you to focus on designing your agent’s behavior.

We’re going to get deeper into smolagents in the next Unit. Meanwhile, you can also check this [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents) or the library’s [repo in GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents).

In short, `smolagents` is a library that focuses on **codeAgent**, a kind of agent that performs **“Actions”** through code blocks, and then **“Observes”** results by executing the code.

Here is an example of what we’ll build!

We provided our agent with an **Image generation tool** and asked it to generate an image of a cat.

The agent inside `smolagents` is going to have the **same behaviors as the custom one we built previously**: it’s going **to think, act and observe in cycle** until it reaches a final answer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQDKcWiuln4

Exciting, right?

## Let’s build our Agent!

To start, duplicate this Space: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/First_agent_template](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/First_agent_template)

> [!NOTE]
> 👉 Python Projekt-Ordner in VS Code mit create_project.sh aufsetzen  -> git clone in Project & Dateien in src verscheiben -> requirement.tx etc auf obere Ebene ziehen -> pip install Pakete installieren => lauffähig 🤗 - siehe auch [[Setup Dev Umgebung für Python in VS Code]]


> Thanks to [Aymeric](https://huggingface.co/m-ric) for this template! 🙌

Duplicating this space means **creating a local copy on your own profile**:

![Duplicate](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/duplicate-space.gif)

After duplicating the Space, you’ll need to add your Hugging Face API token so your agent can access the model API:

1. First, get your Hugging Face token from [https://hf.co/settings/tokens](https://hf.co/settings/tokens) with permission for inference, if you don’t already have one
2. Go to your duplicated Space and click on the **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to the **Variables and Secrets** section and click **New Secret**
4. Create a secret with the name `HF_TOKEN` and paste your token as the value
5. Click **Save** to store your token securely

> [!NOTE]
> HF_TOKEN wird in .env gespeichert, muss in Code dann angepasst werden

Throughout this lesson, the only file you will need to modify is the (currently incomplete) **“app.py”**. You can see here the [original one in the template](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/First_agent_template/blob/main/app.py). To find yours, go to your copy of the space, then click the `Files` tab and then on `app.py` in the directory listing.

Let’s break down the code together:

- The file begins with some simple but necessary library imports

```
from smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, FinalAnswerTool, InferenceClientModel, load_tool, tool
import datetime
import requests
import pytz
import yaml
```
As outlined earlier, we will directly use the **CodeAgent** class from **smolagents**.

1### The Tools

Now let’s get into the tools! If you want a refresher about tools, don’t hesitate to go back to the [Tools](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tools) section of the course.

```
@tool
def my_custom_tool(arg1:str, arg2:int)-> str: # it's important to specify the return type
    # Keep this format for the tool description / args description but feel free to modify the tool
    """A tool that does nothing yet 
    Args:
        arg1: the first argument
        arg2: the second argument
    """
    return "What magic will you build ?"

@tool
def get_current_time_in_timezone(timezone: str) -> str:
    """A tool that fetches the current local time in a specified timezone.
    Args:
        timezone: A string representing a valid timezone (e.g., 'America/New_York').
    """
    try:
        # Create timezone object
        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone)
        # Get current time in that timezone
        local_time = datetime.datetime.now(tz).strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        return f"The current local time in {timezone} is: {local_time}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error fetching time for timezone '{timezone}': {str(e)}"
```

The Tools are what we are encouraging you to build in this section! We give you two examples:

1. A **non-working dummy Tool** that you can modify to make something useful.
2. An **actually working Tool** that gets the current time somewhere in the world.

To define your tool it is important to:

1. Provide input and output types for your function, like in `get_current_time_in_timezone(timezone: str) -> str:`
2. **A well formatted docstring**. `smolagents` is expecting all the arguments to have a **textual description in the docstring**.

### The Agent

It uses [`Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct) as the LLM engine. This is a very capable model that we’ll access via the serverless API.

```
final_answer = FinalAnswerTool()
model = InferenceClientModel(
    max_tokens=2096,
    temperature=0.5,
    model_id='Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct',
    custom_role_conversions=None,
)

with open("prompts.yaml", 'r') as stream:
    prompt_templates = yaml.safe_load(stream)
    
# We're creating our CodeAgent
agent = CodeAgent(
    model=model,
    tools=[final_answer], # add your tools here (don't remove final_answer)
    max_steps=6,
    verbosity_level=1,
    grammar=None,
    planning_interval=None,
    name=None,
    description=None,
    prompt_templates=prompt_templates
)

GradioUI(agent).launch()
```

This Agent still uses the `InferenceClient` we saw in an earlier section behind the **InferenceClientModel** class!

We will give more in-depth examples when we present the framework in Unit 2. For now, you need to focus on **adding new tools to the list of tools** using the `tools` parameter of your Agent.

For example, you could use the `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` that was imported in the first line of the code, or you can examine the `image_generation_tool` that is loaded from the Hub later in the code.

**Adding tools will give your agent new capabilities**, try to be creative here!

### The System Prompt

The agent’s system prompt is stored in a separate `prompts.yaml` file. This file contains predefined instructions that guide the agent’s behavior.

Storing prompts in a YAML file allows for easy customization and reuse across different agents or use cases.

You can check the [Space’s file structure](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/First_agent_template/tree/main) to see where the `prompts.yaml` file is located and how it’s organized within the project.

The complete “app.py”:

```
from smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, InferenceClientModel, load_tool, tool
import datetime
import requests
import pytz
import yaml
from tools.final_answer import FinalAnswerTool

from Gradio_UI import GradioUI

# Below is an example of a tool that does nothing. Amaze us with your creativity!
@tool
def my_custom_tool(arg1:str, arg2:int)-> str: # it's important to specify the return type
    # Keep this format for the tool description / args description but feel free to modify the tool
    """A tool that does nothing yet 
    Args:
        arg1: the first argument
        arg2: the second argument
    """
    return "What magic will you build ?"

@tool
def get_current_time_in_timezone(timezone: str) -> str:
    """A tool that fetches the current local time in a specified timezone.
    Args:
        timezone: A string representing a valid timezone (e.g., 'America/New_York').
    """
    try:
        # Create timezone object
        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone)
        # Get current time in that timezone
        local_time = datetime.datetime.now(tz).strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        return f"The current local time in {timezone} is: {local_time}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error fetching time for timezone '{timezone}': {str(e)}"


final_answer = FinalAnswerTool()
    model = InferenceClientModel(
    max_tokens=2096,
    temperature=0.5,
    model_id='Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct',
    custom_role_conversions=None,
)


# Import tool from Hub
image_generation_tool = load_tool("agents-course/text-to-image", trust_remote_code=True)

# Load system prompt from prompt.yaml file
with open("prompts.yaml", 'r') as stream:
    prompt_templates = yaml.safe_load(stream)
    
agent = CodeAgent(
    model=model,
    tools=[final_answer], # add your tools here (don't remove final_answer)
    max_steps=6,
    verbosity_level=1,
    grammar=None,
    planning_interval=None,
    name=None,
    description=None,
    prompt_templates=prompt_templates # Pass system prompt to CodeAgent
)


GradioUI(agent).launch()
```

Your **Goal** is to get familiar with the Space and the Agent.

Currently, the agent in the template **does not use any tools, so try to provide it with some of the pre-made ones or even make some new tools yourself!**

We are eagerly waiting for your amazing agents output in the discord channel **#agents-course-showcase**!

# Introduction to Agentic Frameworks

![Thumbnail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit2/thumbnail.jpg)

Welcome to this second unit, where **we’ll explore different agentic frameworks** that can be used to build powerful agentic applications.

We will study:

- In Unit 2.1: [smolagents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/index)
- In Unit 2.2: [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
- In Unit 2.3: [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)

Let’s dive in! 🕵

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/introduction#when-to-use-an-agentic-framework)When to Use an Agentic Framework

An agentic framework is **not always needed when building an application around LLMs**. They provide flexibility in the workflow to efficiently solve a specific task, but they’re not always necessary.

Sometimes, **predefined workflows are sufficient** to fulfill user requests, and there is no real need for an agentic framework. If the approach to build an agent is simple, like a chain of prompts, using plain code may be enough. The advantage is that the developer will have **full control and understanding of their system without abstractions**.

However, when the workflow becomes more complex, such as letting an LLM call functions or using multiple agents, these abstractions start to become helpful.

Considering these ideas, we can already identify the need for some features:

- An _LLM engine_ that powers the system.
- A _list of tools_ the agent can access.
- A _parser_ for extracting tool calls from the LLM output.
- A _system prompt_ synced with the parser.
- A _memory system_.
- _Error logging and retry mechanisms_ to control LLM mistakes. We’ll explore how these topics are resolved in various frameworks, including `smolagents`, `LlamaIndex`, and `LangGraph`.

# Introduction to smolagents

![Unit 2.1 Thumbnail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit2/smolagents/thumbnail.jpg)

Welcome to this module, where you’ll learn **how to build effective agents** using the [`smolagents`](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) library, which provides a lightweight framework for creating capable AI agents.

`smolagents` is a Hugging Face library; therefore, we would appreciate your support by **starring** the smolagents [`repository`](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) :

![staring smolagents](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit2/smolagents/star_smolagents.gif)

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/introduction#module-overview)Module Overview

This module provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts and practical strategies for building intelligent agents using `smolagents`.

With so many open-source frameworks available, it’s essential to understand the components and capabilities that make `smolagents` a useful option or to determine when another solution might be a better fit.

We’ll explore critical agent types, including code agents designed for software development tasks, tool calling agents for creating modular, function-driven workflows, and retrieval agents that access and synthesize information.

Additionally, we’ll cover the orchestration of multiple agents as well as the integration of vision capabilities and web browsing, which unlock new possibilities for dynamic and context-aware applications.

In this unit, Alfred, the agent from Unit 1, makes his return. This time, he’s using the `smolagents` framework for his internal workings. Together, we’ll explore the key concepts behind this framework as Alfred tackles various tasks. Alfred is organizing a party at the Wayne Manor while the Wayne family 🦇 is away, and he has plenty to do. Join us as we showcase his journey and how he handles these tasks with `smolagents`!

In this unit, you will learn to build AI agents with the `smolagents` library. Your agents will be able to search for data, execute code, and interact with web pages. You will also learn how to combine multiple agents to create more powerful systems.

![Alfred the agent](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/this-is-alfred.jpg)

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/introduction#contents)Contents

During this unit on `smolagents`, we cover:

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/introduction#1-why-use-smolagents)1️⃣ Why Use smolagents

`smolagents` is one of the many open-source agent frameworks available for application development. Alternative options include `LlamaIndex` and `LangGraph`, which are also covered in other modules in this course. `smolagents` offers several key features that might make it a great fit for specific use cases, but we should always consider all options when selecting a framework. We’ll explore the advantages and drawbacks of using `smolagents`, helping you make an informed decision based on your project’s requirements.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/introduction#2-codeagents)2️⃣ CodeAgents

`CodeAgents` are the primary type of agent in `smolagents`. Instead of generating JSON or text, these agents produce Python code to perform actions. This module explores their purpose, functionality, and how they work, along with hands-on examples to showcase their capabilities.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/introduction#3-toolcallingagents)3️⃣ ToolCallingAgents

`ToolCallingAgents` are the second type of agent supported by `smolagents`. Unlike `CodeAgents`, which generate Python code, these agents rely on JSON/text blobs that the system must parse and interpret to execute actions. This module covers their functionality, their key differences from `CodeAgents`, and it provides an example to illustrate their usage.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/introduction#4-tools)4️⃣ Tools

As we saw in Unit 1, tools are functions that an LLM can use within an agentic system, and they act as the essential building blocks for agent behavior. This module covers how to create tools, their structure, and different implementation methods using the `Tool` class or the `@tool` decorator. You’ll also learn about the default toolbox, how to share tools with the community, and how to load community-contributed tools for use in your agents.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/introduction#5-retrieval-agents)5️⃣ Retrieval Agents

Retrieval agents allow models access to knowledge bases, making it possible to search, synthesize, and retrieve information from multiple sources. They leverage vector stores for efficient retrieval and implement **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** patterns. These agents are particularly useful for integrating web search with custom knowledge bases while maintaining conversation context through memory systems. This module explores implementation strategies, including fallback mechanisms for robust information retrieval.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/introduction#6-multi-agent-systems)6️⃣ Multi-Agent Systems

Orchestrating multiple agents effectively is crucial for building powerful, multi-agent systems. By combining agents with different capabilities—such as a web search agent with a code execution agent—you can create more sophisticated solutions. This module focuses on designing, implementing, and managing multi-agent systems to maximize efficiency and reliability.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/introduction#7-vision-and-browser-agents)7️⃣ Vision and Browser agents

Vision agents extend traditional agent capabilities by incorporating **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, enabling them to process and interpret visual information. This module explores how to design and integrate VLM-powered agents, unlocking advanced functionalities like image-based reasoning, visual data analysis, and multimodal interactions. We will also use vision agents to build a browser agent that can browse the web and extract information from it.

# [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/why_use_smolagents#why-use-smolagents)Why use smolagents

In this module, we will explore the pros and cons of using [smolagents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/index), helping you make an informed decision about whether it’s the right framework for your needs.

## [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/why_use_smolagents#what-is-smolagents-)What is smolagents ?

`smolagents` is a simple yet powerful framework for building AI agents. It provides LLMs with the _agency_ to interact with the real world, such as searching or generating images.

As we learned in unit 1, AI agents are programs that use LLMs to generate **‘thoughts’** based on **‘observations’** to perform **‘actions’**. Let’s explore how this is implemented in smolagents.

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/why_use_smolagents#key-advantages-of-smolagents)Key Advantages of smolagents

- **Simplicity:** Minimal code complexity and abstractions, to make the framework easy to understand, adopt and extend
- **Flexible LLM Support:** Works with any LLM through integration with Hugging Face tools and external APIs
- **Code-First Approach:** First-class support for Code Agents that write their actions directly in code, removing the need for parsing and simplifying tool calling
- **HF Hub Integration:** Seamless integration with the Hugging Face Hub, allowing the use of Gradio Spaces as tools

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/why_use_smolagents#when-to-use-smolagents)When to use smolagents?

With these advantages in mind, when should we use smolagents over other frameworks?

smolagents is ideal when:

- You need a **lightweight and minimal solution.**
- You want to **experiment quickly** without complex configurations.
- Your **application logic is straightforward.**

Unlike other frameworks where agents write actions in JSON, `smolagents` **focuses on tool calls in code**, simplifying the execution process. This is because there’s no need to parse the JSON in order to build code that calls the tools: the output can be executed directly.

The following diagram illustrates this difference:

To review the difference between Code vs JSON Actions, you can revisit [the Actions Section in Unit 1](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/actions#actions-enabling-the-agent-to-engage-with-its-environment).

### [](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/why_use_smolagents#agent-types-in-smolagents)Agent Types in smolagents

Agents in `smolagents` operate as **multi-step agents**.

Each [`MultiStepAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.MultiStepAgent) performs:

- One thought
- One tool call and execution

In addition to using **[CodeAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent)** as the primary type of agent, smolagents also supports **[ToolCallingAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.ToolCallingAgent)**, which writes tool calls in JSON.

We will explore each agent type in more detail in the following sections.

In smolagents, tools are defined using `@tool` decorator wrapping a Python function or the `Tool` class.

`smolagents` supports flexible LLM integration, allowing you to use any callable model that meets [certain criteria](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models). The framework provides several predefined classes to simplify model connections:

- **[TransformersModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models#smolagents.TransformersModel):** Implements a local `transformers` pipeline for seamless integration.
- **[InferenceClientModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models#smolagents.InferenceClientModel):** Supports [serverless inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/main/en/guides/inference) calls through [Hugging Face’s infrastructure](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index), or via a growing number of [third-party inference providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/main/en/guides/inference#supported-providers-and-tasks).
- **[LiteLLMModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models#smolagents.LiteLLMModel):** Leverages [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) for lightweight model interactions.
- **[OpenAIServerModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models#smolagents.OpenAIServerModel):** Connects to any service that offers an OpenAI API interface.
- **[AzureOpenAIServerModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/models#smolagents.AzureOpenAIServerModel):** Supports integration with any Azure OpenAI deployment.

This flexibility ensures that developers can choose the model and service most suitable for their specific use cases, and allows for easy experimentation.

Now that we understood why and when to use smolagents, let’s dive deeper into this powerful library!
