Something fundamental is shifting in software development.  
  
Yesterday I shared how we are creating insights from using Vibe Coding and Aider. This is not just a nerdy side issue, but has massive relevance for how we will develop software in the future. As we experiment with new approaches like Vibe Coding and autonomous agents (e.g. Aider, OpenAI Codex, or GitHub Copilot Agent), one thing becomes increasingly clear: how we build software – and who’s needed to do it – is changing fast.  
  
As shown by FT research and Zeki data, many tech companies are cutting back on hiring. After a massive post-pandemic boom, the correction is hitting hard. But that’s only part of the story.  
  
The real driver? AI has changed the rules.  
Tools like Copilot now handle a significant share of coding tasks. As a result, demand for traditional developer roles – especially entry-level – is shrinking.  
  
At the same time, there’s rising demand for engineers who understand AI — not just as a tool, but as a system to build, train, and manage.  
According to FT, even highly qualified engineers report struggling to land interviews. Without AI skills, it’s getting tough. This isn’t a temporary dip in the market. It’s a structural shift.  
  
The key question is no longer “Can you code?”  
It’s “Can you build with AI – and for AI?”  
  
Would I still recommend my kids to learn coding? Of course! You still need a deep understanding of software and interrelationships, the ability to abstract and translate complexity, the ability to make transfers between different areas of knowledge. It hasn't looked like it for a long time, but perhaps this is a renaissance of education in the classic sense, away from highly specialized engineers and towards broad-based generalists with AI skills?
